# Assignment 2 React App

This is a EventsManager/Todo list application.

Like the previous assignment with ionic the idea is to allow users to plan there day and record important upcoming events which can be accessed anywhere including the cloud

To run first pull the project then

    cd EventsManager
    
    npm install
    
    react-native run-android
    
    
This is how i ran my application. Make sure either an emulator or an android device is connected when running the last command.
